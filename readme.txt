## Next steps:

### Each iteration:

Move the plates and modify the parameters according to the type of interaction between them. At this stage, only subduction and collision need to be taken into account.

### Every X iterations:

Here, remeshing is performed to keep the plates well-formed. A new sphere is created and the plates are reconstructed. For the new sphere, the most relevant points of the plates are taken after subduction and collision have been applied.
At this stage, plate rifting and oceanic crust generation are computed.

## ContinentalCollision -> done ?

## Assure plates are 1 bloc -> done

## Fix ocean holes in continents

## Plate Rifting like in the paper -> random event were a plate cut itself -> done

## Start Amplification step.

## fix triangulation -> Delaunay

## GUI ?
